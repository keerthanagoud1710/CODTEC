OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project: BUILDING A SERVERLESS APPLICATION WITH AWS LAMBDA
Objective
The objective is to build a scalable, cost-effective serverless application using AWS Lambda, Amplify, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. This architecture ensures automatic scaling and minimal server management, while providing robust user authentication, seamless API interactions, and efficient data storage. The approach minimizes operational overhead and focuses on delivering a secure, high-performance solution.

Key Activities
1. Create a Lambda function with IAM role
2. Configure an API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function
3. Create a DynamoDB table to store the application data
4. Deploy an Amplify service to host the application
